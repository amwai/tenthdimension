							<p>Tenth Dimension Analytics is an analytics consulting firm whose sole mission is to make the power of data and analytics accessible to SMEs. It does this by providing bespoke analytic solutions to organizations to help them in extracting the insights hidden in their data, in a way that is sustainable, and that meets their budgetary constraints.</p>
							<p>Based in Nairobi, Kenya, Tenth Dimension Analytics aspires to ensure that any organization, no matter its size or the sector it works in, is able to effectively utilize available data to obtain insights that will guide its business.
							</p>
							<h2>Our Story</h2>
							<p>Tenth Dimension Analytics arose out of the realization by the founder that while many organizations were aware of the value of an insights-driven approach to their business, few had the capability to obtain those insights. Often times, the insights they needed were hidden away in volumes of structured and unstructured data that required specialized skills to extract. This left organizations with one of two options: (1) commit time, effort, and funds to recruit and onboard an analytics team, or (2) settle for generic software solutions that didn't quite address their needs. Tenth Dimension Analytics offers an alternative for growing organizations by providing them with top-quality, tailor-made analytics solutions for their various needs. Whether it is designing parsers to extract information locked away in an organization's unstructured documents and making it accessible to teams, deploying interactive dashboards to help management visualize vital metrics, or building predictive models to help decision-makers with strategy, Tenth Dimension Analytics is able to work with SMEs to define the problem, identify the resources available, and craft analytical solutions that not only address the challenge(s) at hand, but do so in a timely manner, and in a way that is budget-friendly to the enterprise.</p>
							<h2>About the Founder</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/alex_290x242.jpg" alt="" /></span>Before launching Tenth Dimension Analytics, Alex previously spent more than eight years sifting through mountains of particle-collision data produced at leading nuclear science facilities and building advanced algorithms to identify signatures of new and exotic particles. His passion for using the power of data and advanced analytics to build innovative solutions to challenges facing organizations first led him to work on algorithms for automated talent matching at Duma Works Ltd, a leading talent matching company in East Africa. Today, Alex is focused on working with SMEs to turn their data into insights gold that will help them achieve their organizational objectives.</p>
