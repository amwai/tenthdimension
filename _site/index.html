							<h2>What we do</h2>
							<p>At Tenth Dimension Analytics, we have one mission and one mission only: to use the power of data and advanced analytics to help our clients across different verticals solve those business problems that inhibit their top-line and bottom-line growth. Here are some of the industries we work in.</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-shopping-cart"></span>
									<h3>Retail</h3>
									<p>With retailers increasingly facing stiff competition, many are turning to advanced analytics to help them understand their customers better, streamline their supply chain, and consequently maintain an edge over their competition.  Whether it is predictive and prescriptive solutions to address customer churn or demand forecasting for products in different departments, our team is well-positioned to provide those in the retail sector with customized solutions that will ensure they stay ahead of the competition.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-university"></span>
									<h3>Banking and Insurance</h3>
									<p>Banks and insurance companies stand to reap some of the greatest benefits from advanced analytics. With a growing need for those in the financial services sector to better understand their customers, address the global threats of fraud and money laundering, and at the same time meet the needs of a consumer who increasingly wants to see personalized products, it is imperative that banks and insurance companies incorporate advanced analytics in their business processes. At Tenth Dimension, we are working with industry players to build solutions that are helping with fraud mitigation, and with the creation of more accurate customer profiles for product design and marketing purposes.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-users"></span>
									<h3>Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)</h3>
									<p>For organizations looking to accomplish social good, data is indispensable. NGOs that understand this are using the power of data analytics to, among other things, design their marketing and fundraising campaigns, create efficiency in their internal operations, and monitor in real-time various activities in their areas of concern. Our team at Tenth Dimension works with our NGO clients in helping them collect, analyze, and extract insights from data that will guide them in achieving their mission.</p>

									<h3>Healthcare</h3>
									<p>Organizations in healthcare face a lot of challenges in integrating analytics into their business operations. There is the perpetual challenge of ensuring the security of sensitive patient information, but also challenges in knowing what data to collect, how to guarantee the integrity of collected data, and in choosing the right tools to use to analyze the data so as to extract actionable intelligence. Despite the difficulties of integrating analytics into their practices, those healthcare organizations that have been able to surmount these challenges are witnessing huge benefits. At Tenth Dimension, we work with our partners in healthcare to design, build, and deploy Big Data and Artificial Intelligence-backed solutions that help those in the industry provide better care to patients in a way that also cuts cost to both the patient and the organization.</p>
